![Jose](/images/avatar.jpeg)
My name is Jose, I'm a graduate in economics from the south of Spain(Alicante).

Currently, I live in Leicester, United Kingdom. Where I've been for a year.

I would like to dedicate myself in the world of the data science. What I like most about this area is the versatility and wide field of knowledge you need to be a good data scientist. I have experience working as a data analyst on the applied economics department of my faculty. During this internship, I learned to carry through primary and secondary research.  The main focus of my research was financial education, with emphasis on the United States. This was also the main subject of my undergraduate thesis. For my thesis, I did extensive research on the current American national initiatives regarding financial education and, in addition, I used data from national surveys to extract statistical information from excel to perform logistic regression model.

I have been living in three countries so far (Romania, Spain and England) and have visited 21 countries already. It has allowed me to work together with people from multiple nationalities and has given me the ability to solve problems from different points of view.

If you want to know anything else about me, feel free to contact me.
